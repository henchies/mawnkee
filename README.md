A Google Web Toolkit (GWT) app for learning words, found running at http://mawnkee.appspot.com.

The project is mostly a test project for learning about GitHub, git and GWT. I work on it
sporadically whenever I have time over and feel like it.

Naturally, the binary at the previously given URL does not always mirror what is in the repo.
And currently, the app online is not useful at all. (Work in progress!)
