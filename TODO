- Make practice mode work.
 * Every finished practice session should be saved so we can present stats on this on the
   Dashboard later.
- Add italic text in dictionary saying "Empty dictionary." or so when dictionary is empty.
- Add batch add of words -- it's tedious adding one by one if you have a personal DB.
- Internationalize app to Swedish to figure out exactly how this works.
- Implement some sort of whitelist feature and push a working version to App Engine that
  works for whitelisted users.
- Add tests, foremost unit tests (whatever happened to TDD?!).
 * Try using both Mockito and easymock for mock frameworks.
 * Selenium tests?
- Make app personally configurable.
 * E.g., being able to set the word countdown time.
- Improve Dashboard so user can see how they improve and what words they have trouble w/, etc.
